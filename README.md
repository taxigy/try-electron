# Try Electron

This is an example [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) app. You can use it as a boilerplate, a pretty basic one, which is good because you can develop further and add tools and features as you like.

This is actually an experiment with the intention to see how [JSS](https://github.com/cssinjs/jss) works. Because browser rendering is de facto standard these days, rendering stylesheets from Javascript doesn't look weird at all (it still does). One interesting benefit is that the codebase structure gets simpler because each component can be represented by a single file, not a pair of JS + CSS files.

## Run

Easy:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```
